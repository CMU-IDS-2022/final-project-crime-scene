A short summary (3-4 paragraphs, about one page) of the data science problem you are addressing and what your solution will address. Feel free to include a figure or sketch to illustrate your project.

Each member of your group should submit the URL pointing to this document on your github repo.

    From the start of the pandemic in 2020 to our current situation now, we have seen a rise in hate-related crime
    including, but not limited to assault, murder, verbal abuse and property damage. As a team, we have noticed that these came about as a result of increasing racial tensions exasperated by the pandemic which encouraged misplaced blame and subsequent racial violence. However, hate crimes are not a recent phenomenon and extend beyong racial identities. In our research for this project, we have found that hate crimes have predated the start of the century and include violence towards members of the LGBTQ community, various religous groups, ethnicity, persons with disability and gender. And so our project will be addressing the data science problem of what factors influence hate crimes over the years (I think we should be a little more specific like is it income, racial diversity). Given hate crime data at the incident level from 1991 to 2020 compiled by the FBI, our solution will address the impact of citiy demographics, trends in types of hate crimes committed and suggesstions for areas of improvement.
