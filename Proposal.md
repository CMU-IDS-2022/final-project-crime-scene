Question: How human well-being in cities and states influences hate crimes over the years?

From the start of the pandemic in 2020 to our current situation now, we have seen a rise in hate-related crimes, including but not limited to assault, murder, verbal abuse, and property damage. As a team, we have noticed that these came about due to increasing racial tensions exasperated by the pandemic, which encouraged misplaced blame and subsequent racial violence. However, hate crimes are not a recent phenomenon and extend beyond racial identities. In our research for this project, we have found that hate crimes have predated the start of the century and include violence towards members of the LGBTQ community, various religious groups, ethnicity, persons with disability, and gender. And so, our project will be addressing the data science problem of how human well-being in cities and states influences hate crimes over the years. Given hate crime data at the incident level from 1991 to 2020 compiled by the FBI, our solution will address the impact of demographics such as income, education, and diversity on hate crime, trends in types of hate crimes committed, and suggestions for areas of improvement. We aim to accomplish this through an interactive visualization/application approach.

The basis of answering this data science problem is through the Hate_Crime dataset provided by the FBI. The dataset concentrates on hate crimes in different cities across the United States from 1991 to 2020. Some of the features included in this dataset are incident date, location, offender race, offense name. There are about 200,000 rows in the dataset, which gives us a good amount of information to work with and draw conclusions. We aim to gather data from multiple sources as we progress through the project to support our analysis. Datasets on overall well-being and demographics in the U.S. will help substantiate our insights. 

According to FBI statistics, hate crimes in the United States have reached an all-time high. Through this project, we plan to investigate the factors of each state that directly correlate with the increasing hate crime. One of the major factors that we will be looking at is each state's overall well-being, which includes the state's overall educated population, income rates, health care facilities, and age groups, to name a few. The well-being of each state combined with the crime rates will enable us to understand the distribution of hate crime across U.S. states based on the type of hate crime and the total hate crime registered cases.

The most recent spike in hate crime heralds a new cruel landscape in which targeted attacks against victim groups have resulted in widespread increases in the most violent crimes. We want to investigate the underlying tendency of hate crimes from 1991 to 2020. To further glean a comprehensive understanding, we will explore specific patterns pertaining to an offender's bias against a race or ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity. We seek to portray the shift in patterns and the factors behind the shifts through each category of incidents. 

The ultimate goal of our project is to make this world a safer place where every individual can express themselves and cultivate an unbiased society. We plan to use the feature importance of a predictive model to determine the relevant features/demographics which most influence the number of hate crimes in a region. With this, we can uncover the patterns of what some activists refer to as the "Hate Crime Epidemic" in the United States.

Below, we have compiled a few ideas on the visualizations we aim to pursue to answer this data science problem.
