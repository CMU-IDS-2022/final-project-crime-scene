Short (~250 words) abstract of the concrete data science problem and how the solutions addresses the problem.

The data science problem we aim to address is how human well-being in cities and states influences hate crime patterns over the years. Our approach to this problem is to address these issues and offer a broader exploration into the behaviors, demographics, and other defining features behind the causes of hate crimes. Our approach first provides a high-level overview of the prevalence of hate crimes in the U.S. from 1990 to 2020. By first pre-processing the data so that categorical variables are binarized, employed the use of dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to best visualize the data in a lower dimensional embedded space. This aligns with our expectation that hate crimes are generally driven by many factors and our efforts will attempt to simulate that as much as possible. From here, we aim to allow users to direct their attention to any city available to explore the hate crime patterns in relation to any defining features. Users can explore the patterns in demographics and behaviors of a particular city and the prevalence of hate crimes in that city. The expectation is that the features associated with a city (i.e., education, racial diversity, income) would help explain patterns in hate crimes in that city. By exploring this relation, we hope that there will be a enough foundation to draw a robust conclusion. Through our solution, we hope that it will help give greater clarity to what influences hate crimes and inform policy actions and decisions to address these crimes in cities and states. Further study generated from the conclusions of these results would be to further explore the most defining features and focus research on how these features contribute to biases and crime.
