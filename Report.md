Short (~250 words) abstract of the concrete data science problem and how the solutions addresses the problem.
For the public, current visualizations and tools for exploring crime-related data are often compiled into dashboards or graphs showcasing simple statistics of a particular crime. While this allows for creating a concise and pertinent data-driven story of the data, it is a straightforward analysis of the data that may not be very informative. It opens several problems regarding the flexibility of the data exploration with other correlated features and the robustness of any conclusions made from the data. In fact, the graphs, charts, and even tables may not reflect the particular purpose that the user has with the data. The causes behind crimes and specifically hate crimes, are expected to be highly multi-dimensional and, thus, impossible to assign a single reason to an incident. A robust analysis of the causes behind hate crimes will need the flexibility to explore and analyze the data with additional or related datasets regarding human well-being that can help inform us about hate crime patterns. Because of these reasons, our data science problem is to address how human well-being in cities and states influences hate crime patterns over the years. Our approach to this problem is to address these issues and offer a broader exploration into the behaviors, demographics, and other defining features behind the causes of hate crimes. Our approach first provides a high-level overview of the prevalence of hate crimes in the U.S. from 1990 to 2020. Then, we would direct users to explore the patterns in demographics and behaviors of a particular city and the prevalence of hate crimes in that city. The expectation is that the features associated with a city (i.e., education, racial diversity, income) would help explain patterns in hate crimes in that city. Through our solution, we hope that it will help give greater clarity to what influences hate crimes and inform policy actions and decisions to address these crimes in cities and states.
